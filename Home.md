Welcome to the KeePassXC wiki!

KeePassXC (*KeePass Cross-platform Community Edition*) is a cross platform community driven port of the windows application “Keepass Password Safe”.

## About

Fork of [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) that [aims to incorporate stalled Pull Requests, features, and bug fixes that are not being incorporated into the main KeePassX baseline](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassx/issues/43).


#### Additional Reboot Features
 - keepasshttp support for use with [PassIFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/passifox/) for Mozilla Firefox and [chromeIPass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae) for Google Chrome.

KeePassHttp implementation has been forked from jdachtera's repository, which in turn was based on code from code with Francois Ferrand's [keepassx-http](https://gitorious.org/keepassx/keepassx-http/source/master) repository.

This is a rebuild from [denk-mal's keepasshttp](https://github.com/denk-mal/keepassx.git) that brings it forward to Qt5 and KeePassX v2.x.
